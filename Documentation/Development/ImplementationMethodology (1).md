**Implementation Methodology & Best Practices**

---

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

### üìã Development Phases:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Set up development environment and CI/CD pipeline
- Implement authentication and user management
- Create basic responsive layout and navigation
- Establish database schema with RLS policies

**Phase 2: Core Modules (Weeks 3-6)**
- Equipment Asset Management with QR code system
- Work Order Management with mobile interface
- Parts Inventory with real-time tracking
- Basic reporting and dashboard functionality

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-10)**
- Preventive Maintenance scheduling and automation
- Vendor/Contractor management
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Notification system and escalation workflows

**Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Weeks 11-12)**
- Multi-warehouse support and role-based access
- Offline functionality and data synchronization
- Performance optimization and security hardening
- User acceptance testing and deployment preparation

### üîÑ Iterative Development Approach:
- **Sprint Planning**: 1-week sprints with clear deliverables
- **Daily Standups**: Progress tracking and blocker resolution
- **Sprint Reviews**: Stakeholder feedback and course correction
- **Retrospectives**: Continuous improvement and team optimization
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout of new functionality
- **User Feedback**: Regular testing with actual maintenance teams

### üêõ Debugging & Problem-Solving Strategy:
- **Systematic Reproduction**: Create minimal test cases for issues
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Trace problems to their source
- **Documentation**: Record solutions for future reference
- **Performance Profiling**: Use React DevTools and browser profilers
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Logging Strategy**: Comprehensive logging without performance impact

### üìù Code Review Standards:
- **Security Review**: Check for vulnerabilities and best practices
- **Performance Review**: Identify optimization opportunities
- **Accessibility Review**: Ensure WCAG compliance
- **Business Logic Review**: Verify requirements implementation
- **Test Coverage Review**: Ensure adequate testing
- **Documentation Review**: Clear comments and API documentation
