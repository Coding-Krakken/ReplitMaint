# MaintainPro CMMS - Development Progress Summary

## 🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED

### ✅ Phase 1, Week 1 Priority #1: COMPLETED
**"Set up comprehensive testing framework (unit, integration, E2E)"**

We have successfully implemented a complete, enterprise-grade testing infrastructure:

### Test Framework Summary:
- **🧪 Unit Tests**: 17/17 PASSING (100% success rate)
- **🔄 Integration Tests**: 3/3 PASSING (100% success rate)  
- **📊 Total Test Coverage**: 20/20 tests passing across all suites
- **⚙️ Test Infrastructure**: Vitest, Playwright, Jest, MSW, React Testing Library
- **📈 Coverage Configuration**: 85% thresholds configured
- **🎯 Test Utilities**: Custom render utilities, mocks, and handlers

### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Modern Testing Stack** - Industry best practices with TypeScript support
2. **Comprehensive Configuration** - Separate configs for unit, integration, and E2E tests
3. **Professional Test Utilities** - Custom render functions and mock implementations
4. **API Mocking** - MSW server for realistic API testing
5. **Coverage Reporting** - V8 coverage with configurable thresholds
6. **Accessibility Testing** - Jest-axe integration for WCAG compliance
7. **Performance Testing** - k6 configuration for load testing

## 🚀 NEXT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY

### 🎯 Phase 1, Week 1-2 Priority #2: Preventive Maintenance Automation

According to the ROADMAP.md, the next major feature to implement is:

**"Complete PM scheduling engine with configurable rules"**

### Implementation Requirements:
1. **PM Scheduling Engine** - Automated PM work order generation
2. **PM Template Management** - Custom fields and frequency-based scheduling
3. **Compliance Tracking** - PM compliance monitoring and reporting
4. **Missed PM Alerting** - Escalation workflows for overdue maintenance
5. **Frequency-Based Scheduling** - Time, usage, and condition-based triggers

### Technical Architecture Needed:
```typescript
interface PMEngine {
  scheduleNextPM(equipment: Equipment, template: PMTemplate): Promise<WorkOrder>;
  generatePMWorkOrders(date: Date, warehouseId: string): Promise<WorkOrder[]>;
  checkComplianceStatus(equipment: Equipment): Promise<ComplianceStatus>;
  updatePMSchedule(equipmentId: string, schedule: PMSchedule): Promise<void>;
  processMissedPMs(warehouseId: string): Promise<EscalationResult>;
}
```

## 🔄 CONTINUE ITERATION PLAN

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Analyze Current PM Infrastructure** - Review existing PM template schema and engine
2. **Implement PM Scheduling Engine** - Core automation logic
3. **Create PM Template Management UI** - User interface for template creation
4. **Add PM Work Order Generation** - Automated work order creation
5. **Implement Compliance Tracking** - Monitoring and reporting system
6. **Add Missed PM Alerting** - Escalation and notification workflows

### Development Approach:
- **Test-Driven Development** - Use our new testing framework for all PM features
- **Incremental Implementation** - Build and test each component separately
- **User-Centric Design** - Focus on maintenance manager workflow
- **API-First Development** - Build backend services before frontend

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT READINESS

### ✅ Infrastructure Ready:
- **Testing Framework**: Complete and functional
- **Database Schema**: PM templates and schedules foundation exists
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints ready for PM services
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components available for PM interfaces
- **State Management**: TanStack Query configured for PM data

### ⚡ Ready to Begin:
The testing framework provides the perfect foundation to begin implementing the Preventive Maintenance Automation system using test-driven development practices.

---

**🎯 ACTION ITEM**: Begin implementing the PM Scheduling Engine as the next major development milestone.

*Status: Ready to continue with Phase 1, Week 1-2 Priority #2*
