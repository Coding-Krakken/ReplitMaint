interface NLPResponse {
  intent: string;
  entities: Entity[];
  response: string;
  actions: Action[];
  confidence: number;
}

class NLPProcessor {
  private intentClassifier: IntentClassifier;
  private entityExtractor: EntityExtractor;
  private responseGenerator: ResponseGenerator;

  async processQuery(request: NLPRequest): Promise<NLPResponse> {
    const intent = await this.intentClassifier.classify(request.query);
    const entities = await this.entityExtractor.extract(request.query, intent);
    const response = await this.responseGenerator.generate(intent, entities, request.context);

    return {
      intent: intent.name,
      entities,
      response: response.text,
      actions: response.actions,
      confidence: intent.confidence,
    };
  }
}
```

### Automated Documentation Engine

```typescript
interface DocumentTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'report' | 'procedure' | 'checklist';
  template: string;
  variables: TemplateVariable[];
}

interface DocumentGenerationRequest {
  templateId: string;
  dataSource: any;
  outputFormat: 'pdf' | 'docx' | 'html';
  customFields?: Record<string, any>;
}

class DocumentationEngine {
  private templateEngine: TemplateEngine;
  private dataProcessor: DataProcessor;
  private exportEngine: ExportEngine;

  async generateDocument(request: DocumentGenerationRequest): Promise<Document> {
    const template = await this.getTemplate(request.templateId);
    const processedData = await this.dataProcessor.process(request.dataSource);
    const renderedContent = await this.templateEngine.render(template, processedData);

    return await this.exportEngine.export(renderedContent, request.outputFormat);
  }

  async createTemplate(template: DocumentTemplate): Promise<string> {
    // Validate template syntax
    // Store template in database
    // Return template ID
  }
}
```
