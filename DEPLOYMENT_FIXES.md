# Railway Deployment Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve Railway deployment issues where the health check endpoint was failing, causing deployment failures.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Server Startup Logic
**Problem**: The server startup condition was too restrictive and didn't work properly in production environments.
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}` || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
```

**Solution**: Updated to include production environment explicitly:
```typescript
// After (fixed)
const isMainModule = import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}` || 
                    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ||
                    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

if (isMainModule && process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test') {
```

### 2. Module Import Issues
**Problem**: Using `require()` in an ES module context caused runtime errors.
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const { pmScheduler } = require("./services/pm-scheduler");
```

**Solution**: Updated to use proper ES module syntax:
```typescript
// After (fixed)
const pmSchedulerModule = await import("./services/pm-scheduler");
pmSchedulerModule.pmScheduler.start();
```

### 3. PM Services Dependencies
**Problem**: PM Engine and PM Scheduler services could fail and break the entire server startup.

**Solution**: Made PM services optional with proper error handling:
- Added async initialization for PM services
- Added guards to all PM-related routes
- Services now fail gracefully without crashing the server

### 4. Limited Error Visibility
**Problem**: Insufficient logging made it difficult to diagnose deployment issues.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the initialization process:
- Database connection logging
- Route registration logging  
- Service initialization logging
- Enhanced error messages

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

#### `server/index.ts`
- Fixed server startup logic for production environments
- Added comprehensive logging and error handling
- Made PM scheduler initialization optional and async
- Enhanced error handling to prevent server crashes

#### `server/routes.ts`
- Added async initialization for PM services
- Added service availability guards to all PM endpoints
- Enhanced health check endpoint with more diagnostic info
- Improved error handling throughout

#### `server/vite.ts`
- Added better error handling for static file serving
- Improved directory existence checking and logging

#### `server/db.ts`
- Added logging for database connection initialization
- Better error messages for missing environment variables

### Key Features Added

#### Enhanced Health Check Endpoint
The `/api/health` endpoint now provides comprehensive diagnostic information:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-16T12:00:00.000Z",
  "env": "production",
  "port": "5000",
  "uptime": 123.456
}
```

#### PM Services Resilience
All PM-related endpoints now check for service availability:
```typescript
if (!pmEngine) {
  return res.status(503).json({ error: "PM Engine service is not available" });
}
```

#### Graceful Error Handling
Production errors are logged but don't crash the server:
```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test' && process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development') {
  console.error('Production error (not throwing):', err);
}
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300
  }
}
```

### Nixpacks Configuration (`nixpacks.toml`)
```toml
[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"

[start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Server Startup**: Successfully starts in production mode  
✅ **Health Check**: `/api/health` endpoint responds correctly  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All API endpoints function properly  
✅ **PM Services**: Load without breaking the server  
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents crashes  
✅ **Railway Deployment**: Passes Railway's health checks  

## Environment Variables Required

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production" for production deployments
- `PORT`: Port number for the server (defaults to 5000)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (optional - falls back to in-memory storage)

## Monitoring and Debugging

The enhanced logging provides visibility into:
- Server initialization steps
- Service loading status
- Database connection status
- Health check requests
- PM service availability

## Future Considerations

1. **Database Connection**: Consider implementing connection pooling and retry logic
2. **Service Discovery**: Implement proper service discovery for PM services
3. **Health Checks**: Add more comprehensive health checks for dependencies
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement graceful shutdown handling
5. **Metrics**: Add application metrics for better monitoring

## Conclusion

The deployment fixes ensure that the MaintainPro CMMS application can be reliably deployed to Railway with proper health checks and error handling. The application is now more resilient and provides better diagnostic information for troubleshooting.
