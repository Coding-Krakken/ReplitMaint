## üéØ PROJECT MISSION

**Create a production-ready, enterprise-grade Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) that transforms industrial maintenance operations through cutting-edge web technologies, intelligent automation, and mobile-first design.**

**Success Criteria:**
- Deploy intuitive, responsive interfaces that reduce task completion time by 40%
- Enable real-time collaboration between technicians, managers, and external vendors
- Implement comprehensive asset tracking with QR code integration and predictive analytics
- Deliver actionable business intelligence through advanced reporting and KPI dashboards
- Ensure 100% offline functionality for critical field operations with seamless sync
