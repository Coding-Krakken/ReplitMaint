✅ Task

Continue improving and enhancing this project by completing milestones in ROADMAP.md and adhering to the long-term vision defined in Documentation/Blueprint/.

🔧 Development & Contribution Protocol

📌 Core Guidelines
	•	Follow the Roadmap: Implement tasks in the order defined in ROADMAP.md, updating progress as milestones are completed.
	•	Align with the Blueprint: Every change must align with the direction and scope outlined in Documentation/Blueprint/.
	•	Do not modify this directory unless you are explicitly redefining the vision or updating traceability.
	•	Respect Project Independence: Ensure the project remains completely independent of Replit-specific services, limitations, or integrations.
	•	Preserve Tech Stack Integrity: Do not introduce new dependencies or diverge from the current architecture, tech stack, or structure.

🧪 Error Checking & Testing (Before & After Every Milestone)
	1.	Run Validation Suite:
	•	Type checking: tsc --noEmit
	•	Test suite: Run all available tests
	•	Linting: eslint . (or project-specific config)
	•	Manual runtime check: Observe console output for warnings/errors
	2.	Fix & Refactor:
	•	Eliminate all TypeScript, runtime, and lint errors
	•	Refactor unstable or ambiguous logic
	•	Ensure test coverage is up-to-date for all changes
	3.	Commit & Track:
	•	Use clear, actionable commit messages
	•	If behavior is altered, log the change in:
→ Documentation/Edits/ with the date, file(s) affected, and reason
→ Documentation/Blueprint/5-Traceability/TraceabilityMatrix.md to reflect the impact on original requirements
	•	Update README.md and ROADMAP.md with new progress and relevant details

⸻

📘 Documentation Maintenance Requirements
	•	All change records must go in Documentation/Edits/
→ Create a new .md file per change or update an existing one if contextually related
	•	Do not modify files in Documentation/Blueprint/ unless you are:
	•	Redefining the project vision
	•	Updating the TraceabilityMatrix.md to map edits to original goals
	•	Always keep ROADMAP.md and README.md current
→ After each major task or feature, reflect new progress, updated commands, and important configuration notes

⸻

▶️ Replit-Specific Configuration
	•	Run Button Behavior:
Ensure the Replit “Run” button is always configured to run:

npm run dev



⸻

🧩 Code & System Integrity Expectations
	•	Write modular, clean, testable code
	•	Avoid technical debt—refactor when necessary
	•	Conduct full milestone reviews to catch regressions or deviations from architecture

🎯 Goal

Continuously evolve this project toward its final vision with a commitment to clarity, traceability, independence, and long-term maintainability.
