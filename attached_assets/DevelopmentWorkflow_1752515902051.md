## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW & METHODOLOGY

**Implement Advanced Development Practices:**

### üìã Development Process:
1. **Feature-Branch Workflow**: Each feature in isolated branches with PR reviews
2. **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit messages for automated changelog
3. **Semantic Versioning**: Automated versioning based on commit types
4. **Code Review Process**: Mandatory peer reviews with automated checks
5. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing, linting, and security scans
6. **Continuous Deployment**: Blue-green deployments with rollback capabilities
7. **Feature Flags**: Gradual feature rollouts with A/B testing capabilities

### üîÑ Iterative Development Approach:
- **Sprint Planning**: 2-week sprints with clear deliverables
- **Daily Standups**: Progress tracking with blocker identification
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demo-driven development with stakeholder feedback
- **Retrospectives**: Continuous process improvement
- **Technical Debt Management**: Dedicated time for refactoring and optimization
- **Performance Budgets**: Strict performance metrics with automated monitoring

### üêõ Advanced Debugging & Observability:
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow tracking across services
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Performance Profiling**: Component-level performance monitoring
- **User Session Replay**: Debug issues with actual user interactions
- **Feature Usage Analytics**: Data-driven feature optimization
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Continuous UX optimization

- Core routing and navigation

**Phase 2: Core Modules (Weeks 3-6)**
- Equipment & Asset Management
- Work Order Management
- User management and roles
- Basic reporting and dashboards
- Mobile responsiveness

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-10)**
- Preventive Maintenance automation
- Parts & Inventory management
- Vendor & Contractor integration
- Advanced notifications
- Offline synchronization

**Phase 4: Enhancement & Optimization (Weeks 11-12)**
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Advanced testing
- Documentation completion
- Deployment preparation

### üîç Code Review Standards:
- **Automated Checks**: Linting, formatting, type checking, security scanning
- **Manual Review**: Code quality, architecture, performance, accessibility
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing
- **Documentation**: Code comments, README updates, API documentation
- **Security Review**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Performance Review**: Bundle size, runtime performance, memory usage
